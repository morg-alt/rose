          Seamama Photography specializes in pregnancy, birth, childhood, and wedding imagery has evolved from my own
          artistic interest in these subjects and my desire to record women’s unique stories and experiences of their
          pregnancies and births. Pregnancy and birth culturally have been obscured by a veil of secrecy due to
          society’s taboos around the pregnant body, its intimacy, and power. To bring forth life in all its mystery and
          wonder is the apex of artistic expression. My vision of this work is to supply women a canvas upon which to
          express the power, wonder, helplessness, and joy that they may experience on the path to creating life. This
          is achieved by creative collaborative discussions followed by the creation of intimate environmental
          portraits, or through my layered land/flower “scapes”, which capture each woman’s unique experiences of body
          and spirit during pregnancy a time in which they truly in full bloom.</h1>
