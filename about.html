  <h1>Hi! I’m Rosemarie.</h1>




  <br>




  <p class="large about-text">




    So glad you stopped by to get to know a little about me and my work. I've always loved telling stories, but not




    simply with words. When I found photography, it was the perfect medium for me to artistically express myself. I




    truly believe that old saying a “picture is worth a thousand words”. With every shoot, I unveil the unique stories




    of each client and tell them with beautiful narrative imagery. Friends and students have often told me that they




    feel like they know my clients just from looking at my images. They say photographs are the only tangible memories,




    which means that the imagery we create together is how you will remember some of the most precious moments. With




    that in mind, I strive to capture the details (big and small) in the most beautiful light, in symbolic




    environments/landscapes, and with true emotion and expression. I want you to laugh and cry when you look at your




    photos. Whether it's your wedding day, yourself pregnant or your babies growing up, time goes by so fast, so it's




    my job to document your story in all its uniqueness and beauty. My main goal in image-making, whether it be in




    documenting a woman’s vision of herself pregnant, in capturing a celebration of a wedding or birth, or revealing




    the tenderness of a lover’s embrace during my travels abroad, is to capture a quintessential moment of intimacy and




    truth. Whether they are candid moments captured spontaneously or portraits set up consciously and creatively, my




    desire is to record deeply intimate and precious moments and to create memories with heart and soul that capture




    the truth of each person’s cherished experiences. I feel honored to give this gift of imagery which allows us to




    return to these cherished moments, these feelings time and time again.
