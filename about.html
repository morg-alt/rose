        <h1 class="bio">Hi! I’m Rosemarie.



          So glad you stopped by to get to know a little about me and my work. I've always loved telling stories, but
          not simply with words. When I found photography, it was the perfect medium for me to artistically express
          myself. I truly believe that old saying a “picture is worth a thousand words”. With every shoot, I unveil the
          unique stories of each client and tell them with beautiful narrative imagery. Friends and students have often
          told me that they feel like they know my clients just from looking at my images. They say photographs are the
          only tangible memories, which means that the imagery we create together is how you will remember some of the
          most precious moments. With that in mind, I strive to capture the details (big and small) in the most
          beautiful light, in symbolic environments/landscapes, and with true emotion and expression. I want you to
          laugh and cry when you look at your photos. Whether it's your wedding day, yourself pregnant or your babies
          growing up, time goes by so fast, so it's my job to document your story in all its uniqueness and beauty. My
          main goal in image-making, whether it be in documenting a woman’s vision of herself pregnant, in capturing a
          celebration of a wedding or birth, or revealing the tenderness of a lover’s embrace during my travels abroad,
          is to capture a quintessential moment of intimacy and truth. Whether they are candid moments captured
          spontaneously or portraits set up consciously and creatively, my desire is to record deeply intimate and
          precious moments and to create memories with heart and soul that capture the truth of each person’s cherished
          experiences. I feel honored to give this gift of being able to return to these moments, these feelings time
          and time again.

          Seamama Photography specializes in pregnancy, birth, childhood, and wedding imagery has evolved from my own
          artistic interest in these subjects and my desire to record women’s unique stories and experiences of their
          pregnancies and births. Pregnancy and birth culturally have been obscured by a veil of secrecy due to
          society’s taboos around the pregnant body, its intimacy, and power. To bring forth life in all its mystery and
          wonder is the apex of artistic expression. My vision of this work is to supply women a canvas upon which to
          express the power, wonder, helplessness, and joy that they may experience on the path to creating life. This
          is achieved by creative collaborative discussions followed by the creation of intimate environmental
          portraits, or through my layered land/flower “scapes”, which capture each woman’s unique experiences of body
          and spirit during pregnancy a time in which they truly in full bloom.
