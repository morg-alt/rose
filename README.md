 <p>The coders on this project are Amir Doumitt, Michael F. Eberle, Jadyn L. Hunt. We all Attend Madison Academic</p> 

<br> 

<p>Amir did a lot of the code he did the nav and carousels from scratch three times and resized and styled the photos. michael did lots of the css for text and contact page, and about page also helping Amir work out lots of bugs. 

jayden initaly added content to the pages untill they were redone.</p> 

<br> 

<p>first we reacherched many diffrent professional website to get a better understanding of the standerd for these kinds of business sites. We scheduled mutiple times to work after school. many members of the group pulling late nights to work to get certian features done. we also scheduled many meetings with Cristine Harper at theCO for imupt and advice.</p> 

<br> 

<p>we had several problems with the nav and carousels on our website. the carousel we originally coded was glichy and not visiualy appealing. one of our members spent countless hours trying to fix it, when we next met it was better but we kept refining it. our second carrousel was great but had a problem where the image would occasionaly overlap so again. we spent days trying to fix it to no avail. finnaly we did one last carousel and it was aesthetically pleasing and functional.</p> 

<br> 

<p>we did not create images but we resized and shaped the images to our likeing throught the pages.</p> 

<br> 

<p>while at times working in a group was stressful, and hard, (because of technal dificulties), we worked throught it and in the end made something great! i descoverd i enjoyed coding and cant wait to do more.</p>
